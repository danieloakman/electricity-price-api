# Electricity Price Api Challenge

# Install

TODO

## Challenge

In this challenge, you will build a Python-based web service that provides electricity
price information based on historical data.

We have uploaded a week's worth of half-hourly electricity prices for each state to a
CSV. Your task is to create a web API that allows clients to retrieve the
mean electricity price for a specific state.

### The challenge

Your web API should:

- Access the provided data
- Run a web server with at least one endpoint that accepts a `state` argument and
  calculates the mean price for that state
- This application should be dockerized
- Your submission should include a `README` with instructions on how to set up and run
  the docker container

### Resources

- You may use any Python version that is not end of life
- You may use any Python web framework that you like
- You may use any additional Python packages/frameworks that you think are appropriate
- You may use any version of Docker that is not end of life
- You are provided the data in the `data/` directory, which contains a CSV with three
  columns:
  _ `state`: The state for which the model is run
  _ `price`: The price that is modelled \* `timestamp`: The start of the time period for which the price is modelled

### What we are assessing

This exercise is intended to assess your ability to:

- Write clean, idiomatic, maintainable Python code
- Build simple and well-structured web applications
- Handle data ingestion and processing
- Follow best practices in testing, structure, and deployment
- Containerize applications for reproducibility and portability

### Submission

You may submit your application in two ways:

1. A link to a public Git repository (e.g. GitHub or GitLab)
2. An email that includes your repository as a zipfile
